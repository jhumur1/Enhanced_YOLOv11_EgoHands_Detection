# Enhanced-YOLOv11-EgoHands-Detection
## 📌 Overview
Enhancing the fidelity of human-computer interaction requires accurate and real-time hand detection, particularly from first-person egocentric perspectives. 

This repository presents an enhanced version of YOLOv11, a customized hand detection framework designed for egocentric visual input captured from head-mounted displays.

The system detects and classifies four hand categories:
- myleft  
- myright  
- yourleft  
- yourright
   
## 🚀 Key Contributions

- Replacement of standard Conv layers with GhostConv in layers 3 and 7
- Improved computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy
- Perspective-aware multi-class hand detection
- Real-time inference performance

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained and evaluated on the EgoHands dataset, which contains complex hand-object interactions under varied environmental conditions.

## 📈 Performance Results

| Metric        | Value |
|--------------|--------|
| Precision    | 98%   |
| Recall       | 97%   |
| F1-score     | 97%   |
| mAP@50       | 99%   |
| FPS          | 204   |
| Latency      | 4.9 ms |

### Performance Improvement Over Standard YOLOv11

- +12.21% increase in inference speed  
- −10.91% reduction in latency  

The proposed model establishes a new benchmark in efficiency and effectiveness for egocentric hand detection.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Ghost Convolution (GhostConv) layers were integrated into YOLOv11 to reduce feature redundancy and improve computational efficiency.
